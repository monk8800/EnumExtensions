# EnumExtensions
**C# Custom Attributes and Enum Extensions**

Primarily been a Java programmer when started I learning C# for a new company project I found my self hitting the wall as some of the most basic Enum features are not available out of the box compared to Java Enum which are basically full fledged classes which can be extended easily by applying the same OOP principles we apply to classes.  This is not the case for C#, thus this project will serve to illustrate ways to bridge the gap and hopefully achieve the same functionality as Java Enums. 

**Enum extension methods covered**
- Extending Enums using Custom attributes 
- Replicating Java Enum.values() method via extension method
- Coverting enums to string and back to original enum to assist in saving them as a string using EF 6.0
