# EnumExtensions
**C# Custom Attributes and Enum Extensions**

Primarily been a Java programmer when I started learning C# for a new company project I found my self hitting the wall as some of the most basic Enum features are not available out of the box compared to Java Enum which is basically a full fledged class thus enabling you to extended easily by applying OOP principles.  This is not the case for C#,  This project will serve to illustrate ways to bridge the gap and hopefully achieve the same functionality as Java Enums. 

**Enum features covered**
- Extending Enums using Custom attributes 
- Replicating Java Enum.values() method via extension method
- Coverting enums to string and back to original enum to assist in saving them as a string using EF 6.0
